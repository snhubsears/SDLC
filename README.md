Software Dev Life Cycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

It seems through reviews and critiques, alterations can be made which more properly align with users' wants and needs which may have been overlooked or the team may have been ignorant of. Creating user stories helps this by giving a quick overlook of the next segment of a project. It gives a detailed enough description to get across the idea, the priority of the idea relative to others, and the size of the work necessary to complete it, which provide all the necessary foundation for a functional product that meets structural expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I typically attempt to tackle a development project with a little bit of conceptualizing and minor planning then create piece by piece starting with the most fundamental parts and working my way down a vague chain. I think things such as Azure boards will be extremely useful in future development. Currently, any project I work on involves either just me or maybe combining effort with one or two others, so certain management methods aren't a huge concern of mine, but organizational tools and processes definitely are. Keeping to a set sprint or iteration, making note of the amount of work completed within that, and keeping things organized through something like Azure boards are Agile methods and tools I would greatly benefit from.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development I would imagine one would have to be courteous or polite, hard working, submit work on time, able to know one's own limits for either solving a problem or asking for help, able to communicate effectively, and willing to listen to other people's criticisms or tips. Being a single individual with ability is great and all, but similar to the entire benefit of human kind being a social species, we can achieve more if we work together, so being a good team member requires strong collaborative effort.
